<h3>Here are the list of task i did on the site:</h3>
<h3>1) Add “Free product” when the cart amount limit exceeds the threshold.</h3>
<p>For offering “Free product” to customers, we have created the settings where the particular threshold value is set up in the backend. So if that particular value is reached in cart while adding products then only customers get free products otherwise notification messages will be shown to customers that this amount needs to meet.</p>

<h3>2) Show Related Products on the product page using Metafields.</h3>

<h3>3) Disable "Checkout" button for customers until cart amount exceeds Threshold Value.</h3>
<p>I have created the setting for which the cart threshold value is set up in the backend. Whenever customers add the product in cart then the checkout button is disabled till now the cart value reaches a particular set threshold value. </p>

<h3>7) Addition of multiple fields on product page like name, style (Style 1, style 2), Font, notes etc.</h3>
<p>I have created the custom field on the product page for additional information. Where we can write the name, select the option and also write the short note in the field then it will be shown on the product pages as preview and line item property is passed to cart for order.</p>

<h3>8) Use QTY input as dropdown instead of number or text input.</h3>
<p>I have created the product quantity field as a dropdown. When we click the QTY field it is shown a product quantity instead of entering the quantity number or clicking the “+”/”-” to increase or decrease the quantity value.</p>

<h3>9) Add 2 products at the same time using a metafield from a product page.</h3>
<p>I have created one main product and I have added other products through metafield. So that it will be added into the cart as a line item property. When we buy the second product on the same product you need to select the tick once  it will be added to the cart as a different product.</p>
